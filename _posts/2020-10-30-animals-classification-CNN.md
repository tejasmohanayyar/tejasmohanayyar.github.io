### Contents of this article:
* What are Convolutional Neural Networks
* Implementing 4 different CNN models on the mentioned dataset.
* Presenting comparative findings for the 4 implemented models.
* Conclusions

**Before delving into this project I would like to give a brief introduction to what convolution neural networks are and how they work.**
