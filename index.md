|The objective of this project is to automate the process of finding defects in the casting process. A casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. This post has also been featured in <a href = "https://medium.com/jovianml/metal-casting-product-image-classification-for-quality-inspection-using-pytorch-72c696d205f3" target = "_blank">jovian.ml's medium publication</a>.|I started learning about Neural Networks and different model architectures in CNN. Here I am writing about 4 model architectures and what were my findings when I trained my image set on these 4 models. The article was written for learning purpose only and to get a better understading of the improvements we see across these models.|
